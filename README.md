To run a Next.js application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Open your project folder in VS Code or any preferred text editor.** Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

2. **Open the terminal** or command prompt within your text editor or separately, and navigate to your project folder using the `cd` command:
   ```
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Install the project dependencies** by running `npm install`:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the local development server** by running the following command:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your web browser** and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Next.js application. The development server will automatically refresh the page as you make changes to the code.

6. **To stop the application**, go back to the terminal where the development server is running and press `Ctrl + C`. This will terminate the server and close the application in the browser.
